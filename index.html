                    <p class="card-text">
                      Equality is a fundamental human right that ensures everyone
                      has access to the same opportunities and resources,
                      regardless of their background or identity. It promotes
                      fairness and justice in society, helping to eliminate
                      discrimination and prejudice. By fostering an inclusive
                      environment, equality enhances social cohesion and mutual
                      respect among diverse groups. This leads to a more
                      harmonious and productive community where individuals can
                      thrive and contribute their unique perspectives and talents.
                      Ultimately, equality is essential for building a just
                      society where everyone can achieve their full potential.

                      You may not think it benefits you, but it does. Diversity
                      brings a variety of perspectives, experiences, and ideas to
                      the table, which can lead to more innovative solutions and
                      better decision-making. It also helps to create a more
                      inclusive and welcoming environment where everyone feels
                      valued and respected. By embracing diversity, we can learn
                      from one another and grow as individuals and as a society.
                      Additionally, diverse teams have been shown to perform
                      better and achieve greater success in various fields,
                      including business, education, and healthcare. Overall,
                      diversity is essential for creating a more equitable and
                      prosperous world for everyone.

                    <p class="card-text">
                      When you regocnise that others are experiencing their own
                      problems and challenges, it can help you develop empathy and
                      compassion. This can lead to a greater sense of connection
                      and understanding with others, which can be beneficial for
                      building relationships and fostering a sense of community.
                      Additionally, recognizing that everyone has their own
                      struggles can help you put your own problems into
                      perspective and appreciate the positive aspects of your
                      life. It can also inspire you to be more supportive and
                      helpful to others who may be going through difficult times.
                      Overall, acknowledging that others have their own issues can
                      lead to greater empathy, compassion, and a stronger sense of
                      connection with those around you.

          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            Okay, it clearly does. <br /><br />
            But imagine this same page without styling, without design, without
            CSS. You can forget about AI 🤖. Even search engines 🔍 would feel
            useless.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            That contrast alone shows just how far we’ve come. Without progress,
            we’d still be far, far behind. <br />
            But we’re not 🚀
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            Because it took countless people—innovators, dreamers, problem-solvers—to bring computers to where they are today. And if we had never asked how we could empower <em>more</em> people to contribute, we’d still be stuck in the past ⏳
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            No next-day delivery 📦, instant messaging 💬 or video games 🎮 <br />
            No endless movies 🎬, music 🎵, or laughs 😂 at your fingertips.<br />
            No vast encyclopedias of human knowledge only a click, tap, or scroll away 🌐
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;"></p>
            Music would be quieter 🎶. Art, duller 🎨. Food, more bland 🍽️
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;"></p>
            And perhaps most importantly—you wouldn’t know that people like you exist. People who <em>also</em> do those quirky little things 🤔
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            That’s why it matters that we work to make society fairer, more open, and more accessible. Because when more people can join in, we all benefit 🤝
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            And because we’ve already started that journey, we now share more wonderful things than ever before 🌟
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            We find it easier to relate to others. We see ourselves reflected in people across the globe 🌍<br />
            “Finally—someone else who says it like <i>that!</i>”<br />
            “Wait, they also do <i>this</i> thing in <i>that</i> order? I thought I was the only one!” 😄
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;"></p>
            Equality and Diversity only amplifies our ability to create, innovate, and connect 🌈
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            The more we recognise that there's still work to be done, the quicker we'll move ⏩
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; word-break: break-word;">
            And when we move quicker, we can live for so much more 💡
